            Hi Erin! Happy birthday! I hope you're doing well in Catanduanes, or if you've opened this in Manila, I still hope you're doing well. Anyway, bottom-line is, you're doing well and I love you very much. Hi! How are you&#63; I am writing another letter of course, hehe. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, this time, it's a bit different. I'm sorry if I can't be there for your special day. But alas, this won't stop me won't it&#63; I figured I will used my newly gained knowledge to be able to make something for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're probably reading this at your phone. Anyhow, you can read it anywhere naman. I know you don't want that much attention in terms of receiving gifts, and I respect that. I just want to send you a letter to commemorate this event. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my first birthday sayo, and I hope there are more to come. Of course there will be.

            I can't believe it's been two months since we last saw each other. Even though I miss you a lot, like a lot. I'm doing fine. Especially now we have positions in our own Organizations. We will rarely have time. But that's okay, I know that we will be fine. We're going to be fine. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We're different sections now too, and that's okay. We will just find time. I trust you naman very much. You can be yourself. Just know that everyday, we're in the same building. With the academics, nothing will change. We will all still help each other, now too na marami tayong source from all over Grade 12.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also believe na if we can't survive being apart like this, we can't survive in College noh? So I 100 percent believe we will be fine.
          </p>

            Love. You singehandedly charmed my life. I thank you, dahil ginulo mo ako nung tahimik ako sa sulok. You introduced me to something. It's you. I love you so much. It's a understatement to say na you changed me. You changed me for the better. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You have taught me a lot, don't say that you're not smart. You're wise, from all the experience you have. You taught me what to do in a relationship, what not to do. For that, I appreciate you so much.

            Darling my love, I have nothing else to say. Actually I have a lot to say. Di ko lang masasabi now kasi hahaba to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have nothing that fancy to give you, just this.

            Ah, the wondrous force of gravity, bestowed upon us by the brilliant Sir Isaac Newton. Yet, dear Erin, it surpasses mere physics and mass. It is with fervent gratitude that I thank you, for within our hearts, a force far mightier resides. It is a celestial magnetism, an ethereal power that draws me ever closer to you, transcending the laws of science. Your presence, my love, pulls me towards you with a fervor unmatched, entwining our souls in an enchanting dance of cosmic affection. Oh, how this invisible bond defies explanation, weaving our destinies into an intricate tapestry of love. So, I express my eternal gratitude to you, Erin, for in your embrace, I discover a gravitational pull that eclipses the very essence of the universe itself.
